# Repository for the Statistics Modelling project, December 2022

> *by Anna Chechenina and Diego Benito J.*

Here we worked on data on the CpG island methylation depending on the smoking status of the person. The aim of the project was to predict which islands show a significant change in methylation status if the patient is smoking using the statistical modelling.  

You can find our report (*.pdf*) and the R script for the data analysis in the folder. The esseintial plots could be found in the folder *figures*. There are Two Rmarkdown documents for the two ways of calculating the values to code methylation status as 0 or 1, see report for detailed information.

* *smoking_project.Rmd* - plots and calculation using mean and standart deviation
* *smoking_project1.Rmd* - calculation using median

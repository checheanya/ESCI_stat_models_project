# Repository for the statistics modelling project, december 2022

Here we worked on data on the CpG island methylation depending on the smoking status of the person. The aim of the project was to predict which islands show a significant change in methylation status if the patient is smoking using the statistical modelling.  

You can find our report (*.pdf*) and the R script for the data analysis in the folder. The esseintial plots could be found in the folder *figures*.
